**--under development--**

A react website that will search a product across multiple websites/APIs to find the best price for the product. I will mostly be working on front-end react development for this project working extensively with dependencies such as react-bootstrap and react-router. The back-end scraping and API management will be mostly handled in python. Planned to be finished by late August.
